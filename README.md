An application that helps new musicians promote their work. 

Artists can upload their tracks.  Users can rate them, promote them through their social media feeds, and donate to their crowd funding campaigns.

We use a geolocation feature that gives artists a map of where people have listened to their tracks.  This is done through html5 geolocation. 

We use the soundcloud api to allow artists to upload their tracks.
